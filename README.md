# codeslide.net: Open Source Presentation Tools

Test it out at: https://codeslide.net/

The goal of this project is to infuse presentation creation tool with coding. I observed many people want to create presentation that has objects appear one by one in a specific manner, and there are great commercial tool in the market for that. However, the common struggle is that each animation takes 3 steps (selecting object, selecting animation type, and adjusting execution time), which can be a pain in a neck if there are 10+ items like so in a slide. And that's why this project was started.
